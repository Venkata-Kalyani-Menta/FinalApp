# ContactApp

In this web application, I used html and css code to create the files required like,

      Sign up Form(signup.html)
      Sign in Form(signin.html)
      Contact info Form(contact.html)
      mystyles.css - to apply styles
      
 + The sign in form consists of the elements Sign up link, email, password, forgot your password and Sign In button.
 + The sign up form consists of the elements like Sign in, email, password, additional secret code and also Sign Up button.
 + The Contact form consists of the the elements like name, phone number and email of the contact members and save button and to display my contacts table with 3 fields like 
  name, phone number and email and with some rows.
      
 So, if the user comes to sign in page which acts like login, he/she should give his details in the sign up form. If the user is not existed here, he should give his details to register in the sign up form and the account should be created. If there is already existed user account, it should be directed to contact page which consists of details should be entered like Name, Phone number and Email of the contact members. So, if he entered the appropriate details and clicking the save button, the user given details should be saved in the database and that information is displayed in the form of table details.
 
 But the the database is still not yet created so, it takes some time to make it ready. So I just created the layout of web pages in this contact app.
